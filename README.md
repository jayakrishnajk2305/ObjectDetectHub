# 🧠 Object Detection using OpenCV, Detectron2, and YOLOv5

This is a mini project demonstrating object detection using popular deep learning libraries in Python, including OpenCV, Detectron2, and YOLOv5. The notebook includes multiple approaches to detecting and recognizing objects in images/videos using different models.

## 📌 Libraries Used

- OpenCV
- Detectron2
- YOLOv5
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Torch
- PIL

## 📁 File

- `OPENCV.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with code and outputs for object detection using different frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- Object detection using OpenCV's DNN module
- Instance segmentation using Facebook AI's Detectron2
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5
- Visualizations and comparisons between different approaches

## 📷 Sample Output

(Add images or screenshots from the notebook here if available. Place them in an `assets/` folder)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/opencv-object-detection.git
cd opencv-object-detection
```

### Set up the environment

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

### Additional Setup

- For **Detectron2**, follow the official installation guide: [https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)
- For **YOLOv5**, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 Usage

Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook OPENCV.ipynb
```

Run each cell step-by-step and view the results.

## 💡 Future Work

- Live object detection from webcam
- Performance comparison (FPS, accuracy)
- Custom training using YOLOv5
